This document talks about the necessary steps before running the code. All information here is basically provided by [Deep Reinforcement Learning NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

## Step 1. Clone the DRLND repository

If you haven't, you can follow the instructions in the [DRLND Github repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up the python environment on your own machine. The detailed instructions can be found in the ```README.md``` file at the root of the depository. By following the instructions, you will install PyTorch, the ML-Agents toolkit, and a few more Python packages necessary to complete the project.

## Step 2. The Unity Environment

First, download the Unity Environment according to your operation system:

  * [Linux](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
  * [Mac OSX](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
  * [Windows 32bits](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
  * [Windows 64bits](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
  
Please unzip the downloaded file, and put whatever you get with the other documents in the same folder. 

## Step 3. Your turn

After previous steps, you can use ```Navigation.ipynb``` to watch the performance of a random agent and a trained agent. You can also modify the files as you with to test the algorithms.
