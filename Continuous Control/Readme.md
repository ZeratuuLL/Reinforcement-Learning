Files in this repository are related to two Unity environments. [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) and [Crawler](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#crawler)

## Reacher

For **Reacher** we have two versions. Version 1 has only 1 agent and version 2 has 20. All the agents are exactly the same. They have a double-jointed which can move to target locations. And the goal is to move it's 'hand' to the goal location, and keep it there. The goal location moves continuously around the agent with some constant speed randomly set at the beginning of each episode. The reward is strange, but most time when the 'hand' is in the target area, it wil receive a reward +0.04, also with a small amount of +0.01, +0.02 and +0.03. Each episode there are 1000 steps. The benchmark for this environment is 30.

## Crawler

Later I will explain this when I get to work on this.
