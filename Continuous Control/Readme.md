Files in this repository are related to two Unity environments. [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) and [Crawler](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#crawler)

For **Reacher** we have two versions. Version 1 has only 1 agent and version 2 has 20. All the agents are exactly the same. They have a double-jointed which can move to target locations. And the goal is to move it's hand to the goal location, and keep it there. The goal location moves continuously around the agent. Every agent receives +0.1 reward each step agent's hand is in goal location. The benchmark is 30

For **Crawler** 
Later I will explain this when I get to work on this.

Now I have uploaded the files for [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) in the folder which has the same name. For now it does not work. Some details inside. If anyone happens to see this, it would be very nice if you could help me find the bugs.
