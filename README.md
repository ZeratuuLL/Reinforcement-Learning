# Reinforcement-Learning
This is a repository where I put my own explorations of reinforcement learning. Here are the brief introductions for the projects.
  * Navigation: A robot walks in a square world collecting yellow bananas with reward +1 and avoiding blue bananas with reward -1. Implemented algorithms are original DQN (Deep Q-Learning), Dual-DQN and Prioritized DQN. This is also a part of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning NanoDegree of Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).
