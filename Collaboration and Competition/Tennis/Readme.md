Here saves some my files related to this environment. Here is a brief introduction.

  * **Report.pdf**: In this file you can find some detailed explanation of the algorithms and the results of them.
  * **infrastructure.py**: This file includes some basic parts that builds up the agents.
  * **agents.py**: This file contains all the agents for this environment.
  * **DDPG.py**: This file is used to train the agents and save results on a remote server.
  * **Rewards.png**: This is the plot of average rewawrds to show you the performance of agents.
  * **actor_checkpoint.pth**: Saved weights for a trained agent's actor.
  * **critic_checkpoint.pth**: Saved weights for a trained agent's critic.
  * **illustration.ipynb**: Follow the instructions in this notebook and you can see the performance of two agents following a trained policy.
